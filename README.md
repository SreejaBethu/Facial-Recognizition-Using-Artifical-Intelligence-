Created a **facial recognition AI algorithm** in a standard laptop environment and then ported it to a **Raspberry Pi** to make the technology small and portable for flexible use in various applications.  The system is self-contained, runs independently of WiFi or Internet connections, and **recognizes individuals by using only a single stored photograph**.  The pair will extend their research to recognizing groups of individuals, such as for **recognizing attendees in a meeting or a class, and populate a spreadsheet with attendance confirmation**.  Too, the system can be used to allow or deny entrance into laboratories or other secure locations based on an image.
