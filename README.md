This project aims to develop a facial recognition system using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. The system is designed to identify and verify individuals based on their facial features, with potential applications in security, law enforcement, and identity verification.

**Key Features**
    
   **Face Detection:** The system can detect faces in images and videos using OpenCV and Haar cascades.
    **Face Recognition:** The system uses a machine learning model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Support Vector Machines (SVMs)) to recognize and identify faces based on their unique features.
   **Database Management:** The system stores and manages a database of known faces, allowing for efficient face recognition and verification.
   **Real-time Processing**: The system can process and recognize faces in real time, making it suitable for applications that require rapid identification.

**Technical Details**
    
    **Programming Languages**: Python, OpenCV, and scikit-learn
    **Machine Learning Models:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
   **Database:** SQLite or MongoDB
    **Operating System:** Windows, Linux, or macOS
